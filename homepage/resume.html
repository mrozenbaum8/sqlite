        About Me
    </h2>
    <p>
        I’m Moshe, Founder of <a href="https://www.icymedia.co">icyMedia</a>. I have produced marketing videos since 2011 and websites, graphic designs and google ads campaigns since 2016 for startups, non-profits, mom-and-pop businesses, multinational corporations and even former presidents Shimon Peres and Reuben Rivlin.
    </p>
    <p>
        Future job oportunities will be a big step in my career. My experience of 10+ years in video production in Israel, has prepared me to be a successful video editor and the perfect fit for a team with a solid work culture. I bring a well rounded set of talents, learning skills, technical skills, positive interpersonal attitude and an eagerness to succeed that will allow me to be an integral asset for such a team. I look forward to discussing with you how my traits, capabilities and work history fit the video editor role at your company. Thank you for your consideration.
